# Lab 4: Search and Aggregation

### Searches

Let's start by creating a new index

```
PUT /recipes
```

Add data to the `recipes` index

```

```

Search for all recipes which have `chicken` in their name and limit the response to the `name` and `ingredients` fields. Use the [\_source option](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-fields.html#search-fields) to avoid retrieving the whole document.

```
GET /recipes/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "chicken"
    }
  },
  "fields": [
    "name",
    "ingredients"
  ],
  "_source": false
}
```

Actually, there is one more recipe which contains `chicken`. Let's also include `instructions` in our search query.

```
GET /recipes/_search
{
  "query": {
    "multi_match": {
      "query": "chicken",
      "fields": ["name", "instructions"]
    }
  },
  "fields": ["name", "instructions"],
  "_source": false
}
```

Not everyone can spell `Enchiladas` correctly. Fuzziness respects spelling errors in your search string. How wrong can you spell `Enchiladas` before it is not recognized anymore?

```
GET /recipes/_search
{
  "query": {
    "fuzzy": {
      "name": {
        "value": "enchiadas",
        "fuzziness": "AUTO"
      }
    }
  },
  "fields": ["name"],
  "_source": false
}
```

Remember the query with nested data from lab 3? Lets have a look at this again and start by creating an index.

```
PUT /books5
```

Let's add a new book

```
POST /books5/_doc
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Catcher in the Rye",
  "author": "J.D. Salinger",
  "year": 1951,
  "editions": [
    {
      "year": 1951,
      "edition": 1,
      "sold": 10000
    },
    {
      "year": 1960,
      "edition": 2,
      "sold": 500000
    }
  ]
}
```

Now try to get all editions which were published after `1955` and sold more than `100000` copies. Actually there is none, so the result should be empty.

```
GET /books5/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {
          "range": {
            "editions.sold": {
              "gt": 100000
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "range": {
            "editions.year": {
              "lt": 1955
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

What went wrong? A closer look at the `editions` field shows how Elasticsearch indexed the data internally.

```
GET /books5/_search
{
  "fields": ["editions.*"],
  "_source": false
}
```

It flattened the object, so instead of having an array of objects we have multiple arrays, one for each object value. That's why we lost the relationship between `year` and `sold` within the `editions` array. To fix this, we have to declare the field as `nested`. When using `nested`, the object is treated as a seperate document in the index. Delete the index, recreate it with an explicit mapping and do the steps above again.

```
DELETE /books5
```

```
PUT /books5
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "editions": {
        "type": "nested"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `nested` type allows us to create 1-to-many relationships in Elasticsearch.

### Aggregations

Let's look at Elasticsearch's aggregation capabilities. We start by adding orders to a new index. Note that we declare the `customer_name` as a `keyword`.

```
PUT /orders
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "customer_name": {
        "type": "keyword"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
POST /orders/_bulk
{ "index": { "_id": 1 }}
{ "customer_name": "John Doe", "order_date": "2022-01-01", "total_price": 100, "items": ["T-shirt", "Jeans"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 2 }}
{ "customer_name": "Jane Smith", "order_date": "2022-01-01", "total_price": 100, "items": ["Socks"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 3 }}
{ "customer_name": "Tom Smith", "order_date": "2022-01-01", "total_price": 50, "items": ["Socks"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 4 }}
{ "customer_name": "Jane Smith", "order_date": "2022-01-02", "total_price": 150, "items": ["Shoes", "Sweater"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 5 }}
{ "customer_name": "Tom Smith", "order_date": "2022-01-02", "total_price": 50, "items": ["Socks"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 6 }}
{ "customer_name": "John Doe", "order_date": "2022-01-03", "total_price": 75, "items": ["Hat", "Gloves"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 7 }}
{ "customer_name": "Jane Smith", "order_date": "2022-01-04", "total_price": 200, "items": ["Coat"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 8 }}
{ "customer_name": "Tom Smith", "order_date": "2022-01-05", "total_price": 50, "items": ["Socks"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 9 }}
{ "customer_name": "John Doe", "order_date": "2022-01-05", "total_price": 25, "items": ["T-shirt", "Hat"] }
{ "index": { "_id": 10 }}
{ "customer_name": "Jane Smith", "order_date": "2022-01-05", "total_price": 90, "items": ["Gloves"] }
```

Now group all the orders by `customer_name`. Note that the following bucket aggregation skips the query statement in the aggregation query. Usually you want to filter the aggregation results and not aggregate over all documents.

```
GET /orders/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "customers": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "customer_name"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

We can now perform a metric aggregation on these buckets. This is done by adding a nested `aggs` to the request which sums up all values in `total_price`.

```
GET /orders/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "customers": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "customer_name"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "total_revenue": {
          "sum": {
            "field": "total_price"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Let's look at another bucket aggregation. The following example groups the documents by `order_date` and creates a histogram with a resolution of 1d.

```
GET /orders/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "orders_per_day": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "order_date",
        "fixed_interval": "1d"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Again, we can extend this by adding a metric aggregation to each bucket to calculate the total revenue for each histogram. Also, we can use the `top_hits` aggregation to get the top items of each bucket.

```
GET /orders/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "orders_per_day": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field": "order_date",
        "fixed_interval": "1d"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "total_revenue": {
          "sum": {
            "field": "total_price"
          }
        },
        "highest_orders": {
          "top_hits": {
            "size": 2,
            "sort": [
              {
                "total_price": {
                  "order": "desc"
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `top_hits` aggregation can also be used on the top-level to show the order with the highest `total_price`.

```
GET /orders/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "max_price": {
      "max": {
        "field": "total_price"
      }
    },
    "highest_orders": {
      "top_hits": {
        "size": 1,
        "sort": [
          {
            "total_price": {
              "order": "desc"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it :)
